In fact, \\nbefore the pandemic around 20 percent of our U.S. workforce was already virtual. It’s clear that this will remain a lasting fixture of how we operate going forward. Since we announced Amex Flex, the majority of our colleagues in the U.S. have chosen a hybrid schedule, which means they will come into the office about two days per week and work virtually for the rest, \\nwhile more than 40% have opted to be fully virtual, a percentage that has doubled over the last two years.  \\nWe began the initial rollout of Amex Flex in March in our New York headquarters with additional locations set to welcome back \\ncolleagues over the next several months.  \\nAs we think about the future of work, we see the role of the physical office evolving. The vast majority of colleagues have tol d \\nus through our surveys that having regular in-person interaction is important, but my message to our colleagues is to come to the office with a purpose. Our time in the office will be spent connecting with each other, holding group meetings, and focusin g \\non building relationships, networking, and mentoring.  \\nWith a larger number of our colleagues working from different locations, we are focused on creating an environment that \\nseamlessly enables virtual and in-person colleagues to work together. With this in mind, we have been upgrading our physical \\nworkspaces to reflect this new reality with state-of-the-art technology and tools to drive collaboration. Ultimately, our goal is \\nto achieve the best of both worlds – recapturing the creativity and relationship building of working together in person, while also retaining the flexibility and progress we have made together in a virtual environment. \\nBacking our Colleagues', metadata={'source': 'NYSE_AXP_2021.pdf', 'page': 3})"
