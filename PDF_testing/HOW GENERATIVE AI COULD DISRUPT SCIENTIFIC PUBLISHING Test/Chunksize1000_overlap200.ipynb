While science publishers are already experimenting with AI in scientific publishing, concerns have been raised about the potential impacts of generative AI, including the possibility of a flood of fakes. The accessibility of AI-generated content raises questions about the authenticity and reliability of scientific research, as well as the potential for plagiarism and intellectual property infringement. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it may also lead to a shift in the role of human editors and peer reviewers, as AI-generated content may require less human intervention in the publishing process. Overall, the potential disruption of scientific publishing by generative AI highlights the need for careful consideration and regulation to ensure the integrity and reliability of scientific research.\n",
