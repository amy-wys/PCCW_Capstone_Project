The study was approved by the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Eligible participants aged 18–30 were recruited from the subject pool of the Introductory Psychology course. However, the specific findings of the study are not mentioned in the provided context.\n",

      " The current study has some limitations. Firstly, the sample size is relatively small, with only 100 participants. This limits the generalizability of the findings to other populations. Secondly, all participants were recruited from the subject pool of the Introductory Psychology course, which may not be representative of the general population. Thirdly, the study only included participants with a history of depression or anxiety, and did not include individuals with other mental health conditions. Therefore, the findings may not be applicable to other clinical populations. Finally, the study only assessed the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and did not examine other outcomes, such as quality of life or functional impairment. Future studies should address these limitations by recruiting a larger and more diverse sample, including individuals with other mental health conditions, and assessing a wider range of outcomes.\n",
