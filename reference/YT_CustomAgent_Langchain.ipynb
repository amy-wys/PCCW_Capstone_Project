Compress (wrap) the ankle lightly -- not tightly -- with ... At-home ankle sprain treatments. • Rest: The first step in treating a sprained ankle is to let it rest. Take the weight off it; try not to move it too much and consider crutches if the pain is bad enough. • Ice: Use ice or a cold pack on the affected area. Put some ice in a kitchen towel and place it on your foot for about 30 minutes. The early treatment for an ankle sprain is the \"RICE\" method of treatment. 2 This is focused on reducing swelling and reducing pain: Rest: The first 24 to 48 hours after the injury is considered a critical treatment period. Limit activities and use an assistive device, like a crutch, if you must walk.
