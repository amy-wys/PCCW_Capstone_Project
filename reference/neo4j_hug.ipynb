    "# Implementing a sales & support agent with LangChain\n",
    "## Learn how to develop a chatbot that can answer questions based on the information provided in your company's documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I have been fascinated by the power of ChatGPT and its ability to construct various types of chatbots. I have tried and written about multiple approaches to implementing a chatbot that can access external information to improve its answers. I joined a few Discord channels during my chatbot coding sessions, hoping to get some help as the libraries are relatively new, and not much documentation is available yet. To my amazement, I found custom bots that could answer most of the questions for the given library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to provide the chatbot the ability to dig through various resources like company documentation, code, or other content in order to allow it to answer company support questions. Since I already have some experience with chatbots, I decided to test how hard it is to implement a custom bot with access to the company's resources.\n",
    "In this blog post, I will walk you through how I used OpenAI's models to implement a sales & support agent with in the LangChain library that can be used to answer information about applications with a graph database Neo4j. The agent can also help you debug or produce any Cypher statement you are struggling with. Such an agent could then be deployed to serve users on Discord or other platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the LangChain library to implement the support bot. The library is easy to use and provides an excellent integration of LLM prompts and Python code, allowing us to develop chatbots in only a few minutes. In addition, the library supports a range of LLMs, text embedding models, and vector databases, along with utility functions that help us load and embed frequent types of files we might come across, like text, PowerPoint, images, HTML, PDF, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LangChain document loaders\n",
    "First, we must preprocess the company's resources and store them in a vector database. Luckily, LangChain can help us load external data, calculate text embeddings, and store the documents in a vector database of our choice.\n",
    "First, we have to load the text into documents. LangChain offers a variety of helper functions that can take various formats and types of data and produce a document output. The helper functions are called Document loaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j has a lot of its documentation available in GitHub repositories. Conveniently, LangChain provides a document loader that takes a repository URL as input and produces a document for each file in the repository. Additionally, we can use the filter function to ignore files during the loading process if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by loading the AsciiDoc files from the Neo4j's knowledge base repository."

      "1. Graph-based Data Model: Neo4j uses a graph-based data model, which allows for flexible and efficient representation of complex relationships between data entities. This makes it easier to model and query connected data, enabling more accurate and insightful analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. High Performance: Neo4j is designed for high performance, allowing for fast and efficient querying of large datasets. Its native graph storage and traversal capabilities enable quick retrieval of connected data, making it ideal for applications that require real-time insights.\n",
