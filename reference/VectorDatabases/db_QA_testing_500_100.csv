Social anxiety and paranoia often co-occur and exacerbate each other. While loneliness and negative
schemas contribute to the development of social anxiety and paranoia separately, their role in
the development of the two symptoms co-occurring is rarely considered longitudinally. This study
examined the moment-to-moment relationship between social anxiety and paranoia, as well as the
effects of loneliness and negative schemas on both experiences individually and coincidingly. A total
of 134 non-clinical young adults completed experience sampling assessments of momentary social
anxiety, paranoia, and loneliness ten times per day for six consecutive days. Participants’ negativeself
and -other schemas were assessed with the Brief Core Schema Scale. Dynamic structural equation
modelling revealed a bidirectional relationship between social anxiety and paranoia across moments.
Loneliness preceded increases in both symptoms in the next moment. Higher negative-self schema
was associated with a stronger link from paranoia to social anxiety; whereas higher negative-other
schema was associated with a stronger link from social anxiety to paranoia. Our findings support
the reciprocal relationship between social anxiety and paranoia. While loneliness contributes to the
development of social anxiety and paranoia, negative self and other schemas appear to modify the
relationships between the two symptoms.

While previous studies mainly recruited samples across a large age span, the current study focused on
young adulthood (i.e. age 18–30), a life stage where people are most vulnerable to loneliness, social anxiety and
paranoia. The aim of the present study was threefold: First, we tested the moment-to-moment dynamics
between social anxiety and paranoia. We hypothesized significant cross-lagged effects from social anxiety to
paranoia and vice versa. Second, we examined the moment-to-moment dynamics between loneliness and the two
symptoms. We hypothesized significant cross-lagged effects from loneliness to both social anxiety and paranoia.
Third, we tested the associations of core schemas with the strength of the cross-lagged effects. We hypothesized
that negative-self schema would increase the strength of the cross-lagged bi-directional effects between social
anxiety and paranoia. We also hypothesized a positive association between negative-other schema and the

What does ESM stand for in the scientific report of The role of loneliness and negative schemas? and How does it work?," ESM stands for Experience Sampling Method. It involves participants carrying a device that beeps at random intervals throughout the day, prompting them to complete a brief questionnaire about their current thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This method allows researchers to gather real-time data on people's experiences and associations, rather than relying on retrospective reports. In this study, the ESM was used to assess momentary loneliness, as well as other variables such as age, gender,"
Explain what does ESM stand for and how does it measure paranoia and loneliness according to the scientific report of The role of loneliness and negative schemas," ESM stands for Experience Sampling Method. In this study, ESM was used to measure paranoia and loneliness by prompting participants to answer a set of items assessing these constructs ten times a day for six consecutive days. The items were displayed one by one on a smartphone app called SEMA360, and participants had to answer them in a signal-contingent sampling design, meaning that the app would prompt them at random intervals throughout the day.

1. Stabilized approach criteria are not met, as outlined in the FOM for instrument or visual conditions.
2. The runway is not in sight.
3. Landing is not assured. Note: A missed approach must be executed in this case.

Remember, a go around is executed anytime an approach"
"According to the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM), a go around should be executed under what situations?"," If you're flying in instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions and you haven't sighted the runway by the minimums outlined in FAR 91.175, you should execute a go around, as outlined in the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM). The priority is to stop the aircraft's descent by smoothly and promptly applying full power while simultaneously leveling the wings and pitching the aircraft. Flaps should only be removed"
"Apart from Excessive bouncing or pilot-induced oscillations, and Excessive ballooning during round out or flare, what other situation that a pilot must execute a go around approach?"," If the runway environment is not clear or the required visual cues are not met during the approach, as outlined by FAR 91.175 at minimums, the pilot must execute a go around approach. The priority is to stop the aircraft’s descent, smoothly and promptly apply full power while simultaneously leveling the wings and pitching the aircraft to stop the descent. Flaps shall be removed only after a positive rate -of-climb has been established."
"According to the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM), what is the reason of do not attempt to fly under a thunderstorm even if we can see through to the other side?"," The reason given in the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM) for not attempting to fly under a thunderstorm, even if we can see through to the other side, is to avoid sudden gust fronts or low-level turbulence that could cause loss of control. Pilots are advised to avoid thunderstorms altogether as the best policy, and should not land or takeoff in the face of an approaching thunderstorm."
"When we still can see through to the other side under a thunderstorm, should we attempt to fly? State the reason of why should or why should not?"," No, we should not attempt to fly under a thunderstorm even if we can see through to the other side. The reason for this is that turbulence and wind shear under the storm could be disastrous. It's better to avoid thunderstorms by at least 20 miles, especially under the anvil of a large cumulonimbus, and use visual sighting or on-board weather radar to navigate around them, rather than relying on Data -Linked"

Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and computer vision are revolutionizing research — from medicine and biology to Earth and space

analysis, dismissing it as too limited and simplistic. But, as I describe in my book Pixels and Paintings, out this month, algorithms are
advancing fast, and dozens of studies are now proving the power of AI to shed new light on fine-art paintings and drawings.
For example, by analysing brush strokes, colour and style, AI-driven tools are revealing how artists’ understanding of the science of
optics has helped them to convey light and perspective. Programs are recovering the appearance of lost or hidden artworks and
even computing the ‘meanings’ of some paintings, by identifying symbols, for example. It’s challenging. Artworks are complicated
compositionally and materially and are replete with human meaning — nuances that algorithms find hard to fathom.
Most art historians still rely on their individual expertise when judging artists’ techniques by eye, backed up with laboratory, library and
leg work to pin down dates, materials and provenance. Computer scientists, meanwhile, find it easier to analyse 2D photographs or digital
images than layers of oil pigments styled with a brush or palette knife. Yet, collaborations are springing up between computer scientists and art scholars.
Early successes of such ‘computer-assisted connoisseurship’ fall into three categories:
automating conventional ‘by eye’ analyses; processing subtleties in images beyond what is possible through normal human perception;
and introducing new approaches and classes of question to art scholarship. Such methods — especially when enhanced

Why By-eye art analysis can vary depending on how different scholars perceive an artwork? Explain it with example," By-eye art analysis refers to the process of interpreting and understanding a work of art solely through visual observation. However, the interpretation and understanding of an artwork can vary from scholar to scholar due to differences in their individual perspectives and experiences.

For instance, the use of lighting in art is a significant expressive feature. During the sixteenth century in Italy, artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Caravaggio employed a technique called chiaroscuro, which involves a"
Explain how the perception of different sholars on artwork would affect the result of the By-eye art analysis?," The perception of different scholars on artwork can significantly affect the result of the By-eye art analysis. This is because lighting, which is an expressive feature in art, can be perceived differently by different scholars. For instance, the exaggerated light-dark contrast (chiaroscuro) and gloomy style (tenebrism) of sixteenth-century Italian art can be interpreted differently by different scholars, leading to varying results in the By-eye art analysis. This highlights the"

Short-term forecasts (less than 3 days) are generally more reliable than long-term forecasts (more than 7 days). 2. Confidence level: The confidence level of the forecast is another important factor. Forecasters use a scale to rate their confidence in the forecast, with higher confidence levels indicating a greater likelihood of precipitation. 3. Ge"

He knew that Daisy was extraordinary,
but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could
be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life,
leaving Gatsby — nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.
When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was
breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright
with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee
squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed
her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it
made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and
Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery
that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many
clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud
above the hot struggles of the poor.
“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I
loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw
me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too.
She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from
her… . Well, there I was, ‘way off my ambitions, getting deeper
in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What
was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time
telling her what I was going to do?” On the last afternoon before
he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long,
silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her
cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his
arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon
had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them
a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.
They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated
more profoundly one with another, than when she
brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he
touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were
asleep.
