        Paragraph: ```
Social anxiety and paranoia often co-occur and exacerbate each other. While loneliness and negative
schemas contribute to the development of social anxiety and paranoia separately, their role in
the development of the two symptoms co-occurring is rarely considered longitudinally. This study
examined the moment-to-moment relationship between social anxiety and paranoia, as well as the
effects of loneliness and negative schemas on both experiences individually and coincidingly. A total
of 134 non-clinical young adults completed experience sampling assessments of momentary social
anxiety, paranoia, and loneliness ten times per day for six consecutive days. Participants’ negativeself
and -other schemas were assessed with the Brief Core Schema Scale. Dynamic structural equation
modelling revealed a bidirectional relationship between social anxiety and paranoia across moments.
Loneliness preceded increases in both symptoms in the next moment. Higher negative-self schema
was associated with a stronger link from paranoia to social anxiety; whereas higher negative-other
schema was associated with a stronger link from social anxiety to paranoia. Our findings support
the reciprocal relationship between social anxiety and paranoia. While loneliness contributes to the
development of social anxiety and paranoia, negative self and other schemas appear to modify the
relationships between the two symptoms.

While previous studies mainly recruited samples across a large age span, the current study focused on
young adulthood (i.e. age 18–30), a life stage where people are most vulnerable to loneliness, social anxiety and
paranoia. The aim of the present study was threefold: First, we tested the moment-to-moment dynamics
between social anxiety and paranoia. We hypothesized significant cross-lagged effects from social anxiety to
paranoia and vice versa. Second, we examined the moment-to-moment dynamics between loneliness and the two
symptoms. We hypothesized significant cross-lagged effects from loneliness to both social anxiety and paranoia.
Third, we tested the associations of core schemas with the strength of the cross-lagged effects. We hypothesized
that negative-self schema would increase the strength of the cross-lagged bi-directional effects between social

"Based on the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM), under what condition, a go around or missed approach has to be executed?"," Based on the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM), a go around or missed approach has to be executed in the following conditions:

1. When the approach does not meet the stabilized approach criteria outlined in the manual for instrument or visual conditions.
2. When there is excessive ballooning during round out or flare.

2. Excessive bouncing or pilot-induced oscillations
3. Landing beyond distance required to come to complete stop

Question: What is the priority of executing a go around according to the FOM?
Helpful Answer: The priority of executing a go around is to stop the aircraft’s descent, according to the FOM."
"According to the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM), a go around should be executed under what situations?"," A go around should be executed anytime an approach does not meet the stabilized approach criteria outlined in the FOM for instrument or visual conditions, or for excessive ballooning during round out or flare, excessive bouncing or pilot-induced oscillations, landing beyond distance required to come to complete stop, any condition when a safe landing is in question, or if in IFR conditions and the runway is not in sight as outlined by FAR 91.175 at"
"Apart from Excessive bouncing or pilot-induced oscillations, and Excessive ballooning during round out or flare, what other situation that a pilot must execute a go around approach?"," A pilot may need to execute a go around approach due to various reasons such as:

1. Traffic: If the pilot detects another aircraft on the final approach path or in close proximity to the runway, a go around may be necessary to avoid a collision.

2. Runway incursion: If the pilot detects a vehicle, person, or object on the runway or in the landing path, a go around may be necessary to prevent a runway"
"According to the FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANUAL (FOM), what is the reason of do not attempt to fly under a thunderstorm even if we can see through to the other side?"," The reason given in the FOM for not attempting to fly under a thunderstorm, even if we can see through to the other side, is that turbulence and wind shear under the storm could be disastrous. This means that flying under a thunderstorm, even if we can see through to the other side, can expose us to dangerous turbulence and wind shear, which can cause loss of control and put us in danger. It is always safer to avoid thunderstorms"
"When we still can see through to the other side under a thunderstorm, should we attempt to fly? State the reason of why should or why should not?"," According to the Flight Operations Manual, we should not attempt to fly under a thunderstorm even if we can see through to the other side because turbulence and wind shear under the storm could be disastrous. This is because thunderstorms are hazardous and pilots must never regard them lightly. It's best to avoid them altogether. Additionally, we should not rely on Data-Linked weather to navigate around thunderstorms, and we should use visual sighting or on-"

        (Note: This information can be found in the context provided, specifically in the section on brake failure prevention.)"
Does the pilot need to test brakes while transitioning on an active taxiway?," No, according to the Flight Operations Manual, the pilot should avoid unnecessary high-speed taxiing and use the minimum necessary brake application to achieve directional control while transitioning on an active taxiway. The manual also warns against ""riding the brakes"" and recommends consciously removing pressure from the brakes while taxiing to avoid excessive heat, premature brake wear, and increased possibility of brake failure. Additionally, the manual recommends referring to the Handling,"
"Under what condition, a pilot is prohibited to test brakes?"," A pilot is prohibited to test brakes on a runway that has an aircraft in motion or that has an aircraft waiting to take off or land. This is to avoid any potential hazard to other aircraft and to prevent brake failure due to excessive heat. This is stated in the Flight Operations Manual under the section ""Brakes"" and is a safety precaution that should be followed at all times."

Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and computer vision are revolutionizing research — from medicine and biology to Earth and space
sciences. Now, it’s art history’s turn. For decades, conventionally trained art scholars have been slow to take up computational
analysis, dismissing it as too limited and simplistic. But, as I describe in my book Pixels and Paintings, out this month, algorithms are
advancing fast, and dozens of studies are now proving the power of AI to shed new light on fine-art paintings and drawings.
For example, by analysing brush strokes, colour and style, AI-driven tools are revealing how artists’ understanding of the science of
optics has helped them to convey light and perspective. Programs are recovering the appearance of lost or hidden artworks and
even computing the ‘meanings’ of some paintings, by identifying symbols, for example. It’s challenging. Artworks are complicated
compositionally and materially and are replete with human meaning — nuances that algorithms find hard to fathom.
Most art historians still rely on their individual expertise when judging artists’ techniques by eye, backed up with laboratory, library and
leg work to pin down dates, materials and provenance. Computer scientists, meanwhile, find it easier to analyse 2D photographs or digital
images than layers of oil pigments styled with a brush or palette knife. Yet, collaborations are springing up between computer scientists and art scholars.
Early successes of such ‘computer-assisted connoisseurship’ fall into three categories:
automating conventional ‘by eye’ analyses; processing subtleties in images beyond what is possible through normal human perception;
and introducing new approaches and classes of question to art scholarship. Such methods — especially when enhanced
by digital processing of large quantities of images and text about art — are beginning to empower art scholars, just as microscopes
and telescopes have done for biologists and astronomers.

Why By-eye art analysis can vary depending on how different scholars perceive an artwork? Explain it with example," Lighting is an expressive feature in art, and the way it is depicted can vary greatly depending on the artist's style and intent. For example, Caravaggio's paintings often feature exaggerated light-dark contrasts (chiaroscuro) and gloomy lighting (tenebrism), while Alex Katz's works have a flatter, graphic lighting. Even careful viewers can have difficulty estimating the overall direction of lighting or inconsistencies in illumination throughout"
Explain how the perception of different sholars on artwork would affect the result of the By-eye art analysis?," By-eye art analysis can vary depending on how different scholars perceive an artwork. This is because different scholars may interpret the lighting, color schemes, brush strokes, and perspective differently. For example, some scholars may perceive exaggerated light-dark contrast in a painting, while others may see a flat, graphic light. This variation in perception can affect the result of the By-eye art analysis, as the analysis is based on human interpretation. However, computer methods can provide more"

He knew that Daisy was extraordinary,
but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could
be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life,
leaving Gatsby — nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.
When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was
breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright
with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee
squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed
her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it
made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and
Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery
that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many
clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud
above the hot struggles of the poor.
“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I
loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw
me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too.
She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from
her… . Well, there I was, ‘way off my ambitions, getting deeper
in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What
was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time
telling her what I was going to do?” On the last afternoon before
he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long,
silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her
cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his
arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon
had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them
a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.
They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated
more profoundly one with another, than when she
brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he
touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were
asleep.
