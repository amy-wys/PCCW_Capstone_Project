(2014), Momentary social anxiety is measured through self-reported ratings using a smartphone application called \"Daily Survey\" that participants use to report their social anxiety levels during their daily interactions with others. The study found that individuals with social anxiety disorder tend to engage in experiential avoidance, which involves avoiding or suppressing negative thoughts and emotions, during social interactions, which can lead to further social anxiety and impairment in social functioning. The study also found that individuals with social anxiety disorder may benefit from increasing positive emotions and accepting negative emotions during social interactions, which can lead to improved social functioning.\n",

      " The study presents the results of a within-person analysis of the longitudinal relationships between social anxiety, paranoid ideation, and loneliness. The analysis uses both fixed effects and random effects models to estimate the intercepts, autoregressive effects, and cross-lagged effects between the variables. The results suggest that social anxiety and paranoid ideation are both associated with increased levels of loneliness, and that there are reciprocal relationships between social anxiety and paranoid ideation over time. The study also finds that loneliness is associated with increased levels of social anxiety, but the relationship between loneliness and paranoid ideation is less clear. Overall, the study provides insights into the complex interplay between social anxiety, paranoid ideation, and loneliness over time.\n",
