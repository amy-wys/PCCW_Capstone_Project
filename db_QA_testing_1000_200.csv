        Paragraph: ```
Social anxiety and paranoia often co-occur and exacerbate each other. While loneliness and negative
schemas contribute to the development of social anxiety and paranoia separately, their role in
the development of the two symptoms co-occurring is rarely considered longitudinally. This study
examined the moment-to-moment relationship between social anxiety and paranoia, as well as the
effects of loneliness and negative schemas on both experiences individually and coincidingly. A total
of 134 non-clinical young adults completed experience sampling assessments of momentary social
anxiety, paranoia, and loneliness ten times per day for six consecutive days. Participants’ negativeself
and -other schemas were assessed with the Brief Core Schema Scale. Dynamic structural equation
modelling revealed a bidirectional relationship between social anxiety and paranoia across moments.
Loneliness preceded increases in both symptoms in the next moment. Higher negative-self schema
was associated with a stronger link from paranoia to social anxiety; whereas higher negative-other
schema was associated with a stronger link from social anxiety to paranoia. Our findings support
the reciprocal relationship between social anxiety and paranoia. While loneliness contributes to the
development of social anxiety and paranoia, negative self and other schemas appear to modify the
relationships between the two symptoms.

While previous studies mainly recruited samples across a large age span, the current study focused on
young adulthood (i.e. age 18–30), a life stage where people are most vulnerable to loneliness, social anxiety and
paranoia. The aim of the present study was threefold: First, we tested the moment-to-moment dynamics

paranoia and vice versa. Second, we examined the moment-to-moment dynamics between loneliness and the two

What does ESM stand for in the scientific report of The role of loneliness and negative schemas? and How does it work?," ESM stands for Experience Sampling Method. It involves participants responding to questions about their current experiences and emotions at random intervals throughout the day, using a handheld device. This allows researchers to gather detailed information about people's experiences in their natural environments, rather than relying on retrospective reports from memory. In this study, ESM was used to assess momentary loneliness and social anxiety."
Explain what does ESM stand for and how does it measure paranoia and loneliness according to the scientific report of The role of loneliness and negative schemas," ESM stands for Experience Sampling Method, which is a research technique used to collect data on people's experiences and behaviors in their natural environments. In this scientific report, ESM was used to measure paranoia and loneliness by having participants complete brief questionnaires multiple times throughout the day. These questionnaires assessed their levels of paranoia and loneliness at the time of completion, providing a more accurate and detailed picture of their experiences than traditional self-report measures"

Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and computer vision are revolutionizing research — from medicine and biology to Earth and space
sciences. Now, it’s art history’s turn. For decades, conventionally trained art scholars have been slow to take up computational
analysis, dismissing it as too limited and simplistic. But, as I describe in my book Pixels and Paintings, out this month, algorithms are
advancing fast, and dozens of studies are now proving the power of AI to shed new light on fine-art paintings and drawings.
For example, by analysing brush strokes, colour and style, AI-driven tools are revealing how artists’ understanding of the science of
optics has helped them to convey light and perspective. Programs are recovering the appearance of lost or hidden artworks and
even computing the ‘meanings’ of some paintings, by identifying symbols, for example. It’s challenging. Artworks are complicated
compositionally and materially and are replete with human meaning — nuances that algorithms find hard to fathom.
Most art historians still rely on their individual expertise when judging artists’ techniques by eye, backed up with laboratory, library and
leg work to pin down dates, materials and provenance. Computer scientists, meanwhile, find it easier to analyse 2D photographs or digital
images than layers of oil pigments styled with a brush or palette knife. Yet, collaborations are springing up between computer scientists and art scholars.
Early successes of such ‘computer-assisted connoisseurship’ fall into three categories:
automating conventional ‘by eye’ analyses; processing subtleties in images beyond what is possible through normal human perception;
and introducing new approaches and classes of question to art scholarship. Such methods — especially when enhanced
by digital processing of large quantities of images and text about art — are beginning to empower art scholars, just as microscopes
and telescopes have done for biologists and astronomers.

Why By-eye art analysis can vary depending on how different scholars perceive an artwork? Explain it with example," By-eye art analysis can vary depending on how different scholars perceive an artwork because lighting is an expressive feature in art, and different artists use lighting in different ways. For example, Caravaggio used exaggerated light-dark contrast (chiaroscuro) and gloomy style (tenebrism) in his sixteenth-century Italian paintings, while US artist Alex Katz used flat, graphic light in his twentieth-century works. Even careful viewers can be poor at estim"
