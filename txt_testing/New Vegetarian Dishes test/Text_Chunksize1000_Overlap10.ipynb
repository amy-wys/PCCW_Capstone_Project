You can make a high-protein vegetarian dish by incorporating some of these ingredients into your meal. For example, you could make a lentil soup with spinach and kale, or a tofu stir-fry with broccoli and mushrooms. Quinoa is also a great source of protein and can be used as a base for a vegetarian salad or bowl. Nuts like almonds and peanuts can also be added to dishes for an extra protein boost.\n",
