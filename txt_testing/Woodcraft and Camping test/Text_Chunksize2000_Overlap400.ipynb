The next articles that I look after are knapsack\\n(or pack basket), rod with reel, lines, flies, hooks, and all my fishing\\ngear, pocket-axe, knives and tinware. Firstly, the knapsack; as you are\\napt to carry it a great many miles, it is well to have it right, and\\neasy-fitting at the start. Don't be induced to carry a pack basket. I am\\naware that it is in high favor all through the Northern Wilderness, and\\nis also much used in other localities where guides and sportsmen most do\\ncongregate. But I do not like it. I admit that it will carry a loaf of\\nbread, with tea, sugar, etc., without jamming; that bottles, crockery,\\nand other fragile duffle is safer from breakage than in an oil-cloth\\nknapsack. But it is by no means water-proof in a rain or a splashing\\nhead sea, is more than twice as heavy--always growing heavier as it gets\\nwetter--and I had rather have bread, tea, sugar, etc., a little jammed\\nthan water-soaked. Also, it may be remarked that man is a vertebrate\\nanimal and ought to respect his backbone. The loaded pack basket on a\\nheavy carry never fails to get in on the most vulnerable knob of the\\nhuman vertebrae. The knapsack sits easy, and does not chafe. The one\\nshown in the engraving is of good form; and the original--which I have\\ncarried for years--is satisfactory in every respect. It holds over half\\na bushel, carries blanket-bag, shelter tent, hatchet, ditty-bag,\\ntinware, fishing tackle, clothes and two days' rations. It weighs,\\nempty, just twelve ounces.\\n\\n[Sidenote: Hatchet and Knives]\\n\\n[Illustration: KNAPSACK AND DITTY-BAG]\", metadata={'source': 'Woodcraft and Camping.txt'})"
