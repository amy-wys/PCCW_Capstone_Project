Over time, the felt on the dampers can become compressed, causing them to lose their ability to effectively mute the strings. This can result in a persistent ringing or sustain of the notes, even after they have been released. Another possible cause is a lack of tension in the damping mechanism itself. This can occur if the strings become too loose or if the dampers are not properly secured to the action.
